<p class="project">
The social housing was originally designed by Architect Alvaro Siza, this project aims at
re-designing the Bou√ßa social housing at Porto, Portugal. Visiting the site in Portugal
helped me understand the problems for this challenging site which lies alongside an
active railway line.
